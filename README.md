# DND Class Creation

### About the Project

This project is a focused learning exercise aimed at deepening my understanding of core Java principles. Its primary objective is to provide hands-on experience with object-oriented programming (OOP) by applying key concepts in a practical and engaging context designing character classes for a Dungeons & Dragons (DND)-inspired system.

Specifically, the project explores the four fundamental pillars of OOP in Java:

* Inheritance – Sharing functionality between classes and establishing parent-child relationships.

* Polymorphism – Implementing flexibility through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.

* Encapsulation – Protecting internal object states using access modifiers and getters/setters.

* Abstraction – Defining abstract classes and interfaces to separate behavior from implementation.

In addition to applying OOP concepts, this project also emphasizes testing and documentation:

* Unit Testing with JUnit – Core functionalities are tested using JUnit to ensure correctness and reliability.

* Documentation with Javadoc – Each class and method is documented using standard Javadoc comments, enabling clear and maintainable code.

By building this project, I aim to solidify my theoretical understanding and improve my ability to write clean, modular, testable, and well-documented Java code.
